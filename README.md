# Recipe Rails Application

This is a Rails Application that I created for my Rails Final Project at Learn//Flatiron School.
Users can view recipes on the homepage or they can filter it by category. On each recipe page, I also give users to search for other recipes using the same key ingredient. Users who are signed up and signed in are also given the option to add a new recipe as well as give ratings for other recipes.

## Usage

After cloning the repo, run `bundle install` to install dependencies. To migrate your local database, run `rake db:migrate`. Also, you may run `rake db:seed` to seed the database if you would like. To start the application on your machine, run `rails s`. In a browser, go to http://localhost:3000/ to begin (Note: you may be using a different port. Please update accordingly).
